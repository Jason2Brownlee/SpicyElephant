# Spicy Elephant Archive

This repository provides an archive of the Spicy Elephant project hosted at `SpicyElephant.com` circa 2008.

The website was shutdown in 2009.

## About

Spicy Elephant was a website that allowed users to sign-up and learn topics using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

Users created their own decks of flash cards which by default where shared publicly. A paid account could be created to allow the user to keep their flash cards private.

The tag line was:

* Spicy Elephant: the quickest way to put stuff in your brain

The website was developed by _Mayhem Method_ which included: Jason Brownlee, Craig Baker, Cameron Taylor, and Mateja "Matt" Milosavljevic.
